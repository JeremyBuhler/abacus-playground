# Practice repo 
Copy of repository containing user guide, resources, and documentation for the Abacus Data repository. **This copy is for github and github pags practice only**.

## Notes for Brett
I set up some practice examples so you can experiment with html classes and css to affect how a site is rendered in GitHub pages:

- the bottom section of  _assets/css/custom.scss_ contains css examples that apply to any content on the rendered site. Note that these css properties won't necessarily take effect unless the page is published (they don't affect the page "preview"). Feel free to change the properties, add new blocks, and see what happens.
- the [search syntax](https://jeremybuhler.github.io/abacus-playground/en/guides/user/search.html)page shows the impact of the custom css. Headers are underlined and italicized, most of the page has a new background color. If you look at the .md file you'll notice three other things: 
	- the space after the table is generated by `<div class="spacer" />`, which creates an empty div with the .spacer properties that are defined in the css file.
	- the image tag is simplified to `<img class="screenshot" source="...`. This applies the img.screenshot css properties to the image, in this case controlling the spacing. With this approach you can change the display of all screenshot images at once by updating the css file.
	- the truncation note with a blue background uses the `note` class to control the display.

These examples illustrate how assigning a "class" to content allows you to  apply css properties to it. Classes can have any name you choose: as long as the class name in your content matches the class name in your css file, it should work.

The syntax for assigning a class differs depending on whether you're wtiting in html or markdown.
- if adding an html tag, add `class="classname"` to the opening tag of the html element. For example, `<p class="note">this is a note</p>`.
- if using markdown, add `{: .note}` to the line immediately below the line it should apply to. For example:
	```
	this is a note
	{: .note}
	```
